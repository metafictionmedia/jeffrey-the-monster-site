export const synopsis = "After moving to a new neighborhood a week ago, Jeffrey the Monster's first week of 8th grade at a new school goes terribly after being humiliated by Smonty, the most popular kid and only other puppet at school. A group project due by the end of the week forces Jeffrey to work with two other outcast students, while Smonty sets out to make Jeffrey's life miserable hoping to get him to move to another school.";

export const creatorBio = "I've been writing since I was in high school and have been passionate about graphic novels since I was a kid, and more so after graduating art school from the Art Institute of Orange County, Costa Mesa. This story was actually inspired by a comedy sitcom spec screenplay I had written back in 2012 or so that was intended to be a live action adult comedy that blended a world like the Muppets with real life, imagining puppets as another type of people in the world with their own cultural uniqueness and quirks. In that original screenplay, the character of Smonty here was the protagonist there, named Monty. Jeffree at the time was the antagonist, an over the hill famous puppet monster that children loved for his popular show that he starred in for over 10 years. Monty was a dreamer with plans of breaking into Hollywood with his naive ideals and optimism while Jeffree was the guy who hated who he was and the kids who loved him, and wanted to go back to being the monster he always was: making horror movies where he was the Monster. Except his studio contract wouldn't allow it, and he would make things difficult for his agent, who's name was Sam (she may or may not be the same Sam he meets here, it has yet to be determined). To keep. him in line, she tasks her assistant Barry (who also may or may not be the same Barry here) to keep him in line, but Barry isn't quite the strong minded person needed for that and Jeffree tries to make everything as hard as possible for the both of them. Monty's new roommate in the script was Sam's best friend, and he tries to get him to introduce the two so he can make his great impression and get. his foot in the door. \n\nIt was a story that always stuck with me and when I had the idea to do a graphic novel now, one of the first ones to come up was: what if I focused on Jeffree as a teenager before he gets to where he is in that script? One of his throwaway lines that seemed to stick with me was that he wrote a 1500 page autobiography that no one wanted to publish but that he quotes constantly to make his points and is always complaining that the studio stole it from him so they could water it down and turn it in to a children's book that make him into this sweet funny character that isn't him. And so I thought, what if I did that book, the story that IS the watered down version of his autobiography. So while this has taken a few detours on the way to becoming complete, the soul of that idea is still there beneath it all: this is the story of Jeffree's teenage years and actually happened. Is it the watered down kids version he hates though? Probably not. Is it his overwritten and pretentious 1500 page manuscript brought to life with artwork and panels? No way, that's ridiculous. It's more like an amalgamation of the two. It sticks closer to the truth of who he was and his story while avoiding the constant patting on the back and complaining about everyone else that take up most of the pages he whines about. \n\nThis is the first of four parts, which all will be released as a complete book next year. I hope you enjoy it, and eventually come to tolerate Jeffree like Barry and Sam eventually do. He may not seem like it,  but he lives to entertain.";

    bio:  "Jeffrey is not your average kid—or your average monster. At thirteen, he's the new kid in town, trying to survive junior high while carrying around a reputation he never asked for. To his classmates, Jeffrey looks like trouble: sarcastic, stubborn, and a little too sharp for his own good. But beneath the growls and eye-rolls is someone who just wants to belong, even if he'd never admit it out loud. Jeffrey secretly loves magic shows and dreams of performing one day, but he hides that side of himself, convinced it makes him vulnerable. He's quick with comebacks, allergic to being told what to do, and constantly checking the weather—because nothing ruins his day faster than rain on his fur. Most kids keep their distance, which suits him fine… except for Barry, a younger classmate who insists on being his best friend. In Jeffrey's world, monsters and humans live side by side, but Jeffrey can't shake the feeling that being born a monster means he'll always be seen as 'bad.' His story is about proving—mostly to himself—that maybe being different doesn't mean being doomed."

    bio: "Barry is the kind of kid most people overlook—until he opens his mouth. He has a habit of explaining things no one asked about, blurting out facts or backstories like he's trying to make sense of the world before it slips away. One thing he'll never do is lie; Barry tells the truth even when it makes situations harder, which, for a middle-schooler, is saying a lot. At home, things aren't easy, though Barry rarely talks about it directly. He's learned to shrug off blame, laugh at the wrong times, and keep going no matter what. That quiet resilience is what makes him unshaken by Jeffrey—next to the chaos Barry already knows, a sarcastic monster isn't nearly as scary. Most kids don't get why Barry insists Jeffrey is his best friend, but Barry doesn't care. Loyalty, to him, isn't optional. He may not be the loudest, the smartest, or the most popular, but he's the one who sticks around. And in a world where most people look away, that makes him one of a kind."

    image: "/images/characters/smonty.jpg", 
    bio: "Smonty—short for Smontgomery, though he insists on the full version whenever possible—is the most popular kid at school, at least on the surface. His hyper energy and constant chatter mean he's everywhere at once, bouncing from group to group like a frog skipping across floating logs. Everyone knows him, but very few stick around long enough to really know him. That's the paradox of Smonty: he's surrounded by people, yet has almost no close friends. He dreams big—fame, spotlight, the works—and sees himself as destined to follow in the footsteps of legendary puppet actors whose names are somehow always on the tip of your tongue. His short attention span and need for constant movement make him hard to pin down, but they also keep him in the middle of everything happening at school. Jeffrey, though, is the one thing Smonty can't shrug off. As the only other puppet in class, Jeffrey represents everything Smonty doesn't want puppets to be: quiet, sarcastic, unwilling to play along. To Smonty, that feels like a personal insult, and he can't let it go. Their clash isn't just about personalities—it's about identity, and Smonty isn't the type to back down."

    bio: "Sam is the kind of student teachers love—sharp, serious, and always one step ahead of the lesson. Her classmates, though, aren't always sure what to make of her. She doesn't waste words, she doesn't play along with nonsense, and she definitely doesn't put up with bullies. Where others laugh or stay quiet, Sam speaks up, even when it costs her. She's not interested in popularity contests or fitting into neat little boxes. Sam values fairness and has no patience for people who try to get by on charm or shortcuts. She's the type to roll her eyes when others lose focus, but she's also the one who will hold things together when everything starts to fall apart. Sam may not call herself a leader, but her calm confidence and blunt honesty give her a gravity that others can't ignore. Whether her classmates admit it or not, the room always feels a little different when Sam's in it."

But someone has to keep track of all the eye-rolling, storm-off arguments, and poorly thought-out decisions these kids keep making. He'll tell you he's impartial. He isn't. He'll say he doesn't interrupt. He does. And while he insists he's only here to explain what's happening, the truth is he's enjoying himself far too much." }

export const storyPageSynopsis = `Jeffrey the Monster didn't ask to be the new kid. He didn't ask to start over in a strange neighborhood, in a school where nobody knows him, and where the most popular kid just happens to be another puppet. But life rarely asks permission—it just hands you a mess and dares you to figure it out.

The first week of eighth grade was already a disaster: wrong impressions, quick judgments, and enough eye-rolling to power a small town. Leave it to Jeffrey to turn it into the kind of disaster that spawns made-for-TV movies and cautionary tales you pass down to your kids, hoping they never go through anything like it. His sharp tongue and short fuse earned him a reputation that trails into every classroom he manages to doze off in. But it was his bad luck—and worse judgment—that landed him in the crosshairs of the only other puppet at the school: Smonty, the self-appointed king of popularity, determined to make sure Jeffrey never forgets his place.

His place, of course, was the garage—where he could avoid his parents, who were somehow both dismissive and deafening at the same time. At school, he was attached to Barry, his mom-assigned conjoined twin, a label Jeffrey wished he could rip off every time Barry opened his mouth. And like the work of a sociopathic writer, things only got worse: he was grouped with Barry and Sam—a girl so determined to be the best that even the teachers seemed intimidated by her—for the one event he feared most: the Talent Show. In other words, the perfect setup for everything to go spectacularly wrong.

And stories like this aren't really about fitting in—unless we're talking about pants that should never be worn by anyone, least of all a monster who doesn't even own a pair. No, stories like this are about the legends that start when kids who don't belong anywhere find themselves stuck together, forced to figure out if being outcasts means being alone… or being the last ones standing.

And through all the drama, sharp comebacks, and questionable decisions, I'll be here to keep things honest. Not to help, not to fix, but to make sure you don't miss a single running gag, subtle homage, or hidden clue that takes the whole thing from confusing to coherent. Otherwise, you might just mistake the smoke and mirrors for a monster and his magic. Don't ask me what it means—it just sounded good.`;
